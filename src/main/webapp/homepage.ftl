            <p class="card-text" style="margin-bottom: 12px">"The Starry Night" (1889) is not just one of the paintings of post-impressionism, and not just one of the paintings of the most prominent representative of this trend - Vincent Van Gogh. "Starry Night" is perhaps the most famous painting by the Dutch artist, which has stepped far beyond the limited painting club and became common to all mankind - as happened, for example, with "The Card Players" by Paul Cezanne or "The Persistence of Memory" by Salvador Dali.</p>

            <p class="card-text" style="margin-bottom: 12px">One of the best paintings by Vincent Van Gogh - "Blooming Almond Branches", was painted by the artist in early 1890 in Saint-Remy de Provence, just before another seizure. The reason for painting the picture was the most serious: the day before, in a letter, Vincent's brother Theo announced the birth of a son named after the artist - Vincent. Van Gogh was moved to the depths of his soul and immediately took to work.</p>

            <p class="card-text" style="margin-bottom: 12px">The painting "The Starry Night over the Rhone", painted by Vincent Van Gogh in 1888 in Arles, is rightfully one of the artist's most famous works and can be considered the first manifestation of the "obsession" that Vincent felt then in his certainly desire to paint exactly the dark time of day is night. In April 1888, he wrote to his brother Theo: "I want a starry night with cypresses or perhaps over a field of ripe wheat." In June, he confessed to the artist Emile Bernard: "When, when will I finally dare to paint a starry sky, the thought of which literally does not leave me for a minute."</p>

            <p class="card-text" style="margin-bottom: 12px">Painting "Night Cafe" demanded from the artist three nights of hard work, after which Vincent slept off during the day. The station cafe, the interiors of which are depicted in the picture, was not a stranger to Van Gogh - he was his regular and knew very well the owner of the establishment, Joseph-Michel, and his wife Marie Ginot, who even posed for the artist for the painting "Arlesienne".</p>

De rode wijngaard) was painted by Vincent Van Gogh in 1888 and is rightfully considered one of the most famous works of the so-called "Arles period". For a long time it was also accepted that the "Red Vineyards in Arles" - the only painting sold during the artist's life - but this statement does not correspond to reality.</p>
